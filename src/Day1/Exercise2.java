//Exercise 2 
//Write a function that takes an int n as parameter, and creates n threads, running at the same time. Use a for loop to create the threads.
//Each thread should print the numbers from 1 to 100.
//Have the threads print an identifier with each number, so you can see which thread prints what (use the iteration variable from the outer loop where the thread is created).
//a) describe the output. Is it what you expected?
//b) If the threads do not interleave, can you make them, by making the threads sleep for a short period of time? (think milliseconds).
